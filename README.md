# Statistics Explorer

Statistics Explorer is a prototype of an application which enables the user to browse statistics about different regions of Estonia using an interactive map.

It was put together within 24 hours at the [Garage48 Visualising Data hackathon](http://garage48.org/events/garage48-visualising-data).
