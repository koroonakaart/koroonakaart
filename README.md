# Koroonakaart

Koroonakaart is a project which aims to give accurate and up-to-date information about the Covid-19 epidemic in Estonia.

The project is currently managed by Open Knowledge Estonia. GitHub repository: [https://github.com/okestonia/koroonakaart](https://github.com/okestonia/koroonakaart). The live version is available at [koroonakaart.ee](https://koroonakaart.ee/). The data is updated every day around 11:00 Estonian time, depending on the TEHIK data update. The app is published in three language versions: Estonian, English, and Russian.

## Data

All data used by our application can be accessed directly at the following link: https://www.koroonakaart.ee/data.json

## Project setup

### Install prerequisites

Install `poetry` to manage Python dependencies: [https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation)

### Get/update data from TEHIK API

After cloning the repository, you will need to download the latest Estonian COVID-19 data from TEHIK in order for the app to compile.

```bash
cd build/
poetry install
poetry run download
poetry run update_data
```

Note: At present, the update process won't work if carried out between midnight and the time that TEHIK updates their data, which is typically sometime between 11am and noon Estonian time. We realise this isn't ideal and are working to improve the process.

## How the team formed at [Hack the Crisis](https://www.facebook.com/events/204692110602347/)

The app was originally built in around 24 hours as part of the Hack the Crisis hackathon put on by Garage48 in Estonia. It was developed by Harry Sild (@Kypsis), Chris Thompson (@neuroactive), Joonas Puura (@PuuraJ), and Keegan McBride (@Keeganmcbride). Hanna Maria Mägi came up with the initial design. Maarja Leena Saar and Sven Illing have also contributed.
