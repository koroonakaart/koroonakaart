# Koroonakaart

Koroonakaart is a project which aims to give accurate and up-to-date information about the Covid-19 epidemic in Estonia.

This is a fork of the repo managed by Open Knowledge
Estonia: [https://github.com/okestonia/koroonakaart](https://github.com/okestonia/koroonakaart).

GitHub Actions are used to automatically download latest data and rebuild the site. The data which is not easily
available from external APIs is automatically updated to the repository after scraping.

The generated site is hosted on GitHub Pages with Cloudflare caching
at [https://koroonakaart.cocreators.ee/](https://koroonakaart.cocreators.ee/) - consider this a backup

## Project setup

### Install prerequisites

Install Python appropriately for your environment. Especially on Windows, if you installed from Microsoft Store, please ensure the "Scripts" directory is added on your `PATH` properly.

You can check with `where python.exe` where Python was installed to, and you should ensure the `Python3x\Scripts` directory is included in your `PATH` ([https://datatofish.com/add-python-to-windows-path/](https://datatofish.com/add-python-to-windows-path/)). Alternatively if this does not work, after installing `pre-commit` run `where /R C:\ pre-commit.exe` to locate the correct `Scripts` directory.

Install `poetry` to manage Python
dependencies: [https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation)

Install `pre-commit` to do automatic code analysis and formatting before committing changes: [https://pre-commit.com/#install](https://pre-commit.com/#install)

### Get/update data from TEHIK API

After cloning the repository, you will need to download the latest Estonian COVID-19 data from TEHIK in order for the
app to compile, after which we can generate the chart data for the frontend.

```bash
poetry install
poetry run download
poetry run generate

# Or if you have plenty of memory and CPU - this will take about 14GB of RAM and optimize time spent
poetry run generate --parallel 6
# Larger numbers will eat greatly more RAM without significantly improving performance
```

If you're working on the data generators, you can run an individual script as well:

```bash
poetry run python build/generate_x.py
```

Note: At present, the update process won't work if carried out between midnight and the time that TEHIK updates their
data, which is typically sometime between 11am and noon Estonian time. We realise this isn't ideal and are working to
improve the process.

### Install front-end dependencies

To Customize Vue.js configuration see [Configuration Reference](https://cli.vuejs.org/config/).

```bash
cd koroonakaart/
npm install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development

```bash
npm run serve
```

### Compiles and minifies for production

```bash
npm run build
```

### Lints and fixes files

```bash
npm run lint
```

# History

## How the team formed at [Hack the Crisis](https://www.facebook.com/events/204692110602347/)

The app was originally built in around 24 hours as part of the Hack the Crisis hackathon put on by Garage48 in Estonia.
It was developed by Harry Sild (@Kypsis), Chris Thompson (@neuroactive), Joonas Puura (@PuuraJ), and Keegan McBride (
@Keeganmcbride). Hanna Maria Mägi came up with the initial design. Maarja Leena Saar and Sven Illing have also
contributed.
